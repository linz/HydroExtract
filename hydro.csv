Traditionally the bathymetric data collected during hydrographic surveys was rendered only as sounding sheets in hard copy form, often as A1 (or larger) sheets. More recently, the bathymetric datasets have often been rendered as both sounding sheets and as digital data files, with the provision of sounding sheets diminishing over time. The sounding sheets have been scanned and georeferenced to make them available as TIFF images. This index has been derived from the extents of the georeferenced images and information held in the LINZ's hydrographic information database.
